# Classification-of-Breast-Cancer-Tumours
Using Supervised Learning algorithm to binary classify malignant and benign tumour cells

To increase the accuracy of cancer tumour diagnosis, machine learning methods are applied as they yield better classification than human performance. Here, a supervised learning classifier leveraging a Logistic
Regression algorithm has been developed to determine whether a patient has benign or
malignant cells. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms
of accuracy, recall, precision, k-fold cross validation, along with area
under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC curve). To
optimise the model, a wrapper and filter feature
selection method have been implemented, which reduces irrelevant attributes and only attains
key underlying features.
